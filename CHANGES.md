## 2.0.DEV17 (2024-06-05)

### New `MultiLCA` implementation

The new `MultiLCA` implementation support efficient calculation of multiple functional units, impact categories, normalizations, and weightings, and supports advanced features of `bw_processign` datapackages across the complete calculation chain, including scenarios and correlated uncertainty. It also adds usability improvements compared to previous implementations.

To perform a `MultiLCA`, you first need to define your configuration. There is a `pydantic` [validator `MethodConfig`](https://github.com/brightway-lca/brightway2-calc/blob/9c94ec64c68103d21f4c7d262c3038e83fb09978/bw2calc/method_config.py#L8) to make sure it is constructed correctly; see its docs for more info.

Here is an example `MultiLCA` calculation in action:

```python
import bw2data as bd
import bw2io as bi

# All the LCI and LCIA data exist in the current project
functional_units = {
    "γ": {bd.get_node(name="foo").id: 1},
    "ε": {bd.get_node(name="bar").id: 2},
    "ζ": {bd.get_node(name="baz").id: 3},
}
config = {
    "impact_categories": [
        ("first", "categ."),
        ("second", "categ."),
    ],
    "normalizations": {
        ("am I normal?",): [
            ("first", "categ."),
            ("second", "categ."),
        ]
    },
    "weightings": {("heavy", "weight"): [("am I normal?",)]},
}
data_objs = bd.get_multilca_data_objs(functional_units=functional_units, method_config=config)
mlca = MultiLCA(demands=functional_units, method_config=config, data_objs=data_objs)
mlca.lci()
mlca.lcia()
mlca.normalize()
mlca.weight()
mlca.scores
>>> {
  (("heavy", "weight"), ("am I normal?",), ('first', 'categ.'), 'γ'): 190.31896453011996,
  (("heavy", "weight"), ("am I normal?",), ('first', 'categ.'), 'ε'): 42.504568745060126,
  (("heavy", "weight"), ("am I normal?",), ('first', 'categ.'), 'ζ'): 431.9104810103497,
  (("heavy", "weight"), ("am I normal?",), ('second', 'categ.'), 'γ'): 1205.2506281852936,
  (("heavy", "weight"), ("am I normal?",), ('second', 'categ.'), 'ε'): 269.17264029471556,
  (("heavy", "weight"), ("am I normal?",), ('second', 'categ.'), 'ζ'): 5614.00396766416
}
```

One big change compared to previous implementations is the labelling of matrices and results, which is used across the `MultiLCA` class.

The `MultiLCA` class can be used for both static and Monte Carlo calculations. You can configure which types of uncertainty to use where with `selective_use`. See the [`MultiLCA` class docs](https://github.com/brightway-lca/brightway2-calc/blob/main/bw2calc/multi_lca.py) for more information.

Here is an example of a selective use config. In this case, assuming `use_distributions=False` was passed to the `MultiLCA` constructor, on the characterization and weighting matrices would draw from the probability distribution information provided.

```python
{
    "characterization_matrix": {"use_distributions": True},
    "weighting_matrix": {"use_distributions": True},
}
```

**Gotcha**: In `MultiLCA`, you need to use the selective use flags `characterization_matrix`, `normalization_matrix`, and `weighting_matrix`, even though all three of these are dictionaries, and called `characterization_matrices`, `normalization_matrices`, and `weighting_matrices`. This is because selective use flags can also be used in the base `LCA` class, and use the same code. The flags apply to **all** impact categories, normalizations, and weightings; You would need to write a custom subclass to turn on certain forms of uncertainty only for selected impact categories.

Result matrices (`characterized_inventories`, `normalized_inventories`, `weighted_inventories`) are all dictionaries, with each combination of functional unit and impact category/normalization/weighting possible as described in the `MethodConfig`. The values in this dictionary are sparse matrices with the same dimensions as the `inventory`, namely biosphere flows (rows) by processes (columns).

# 2.0.DEV1

Version 2.0 brings a number of large changes, while maintaining backwards compatibility (except for dropping Py2). The net result of these changes is to prepare for a future where data management is separated from calculations, and where working with large, complicated models is much easier.

## Future DEV releases

Before 2.0 is released, the following features will be added:

* Presamples will be adapted to use `bw_processing`
* Logging will be taken seriously :)
* ~~LCA results to dataframes~~

## Breaking changes

### Simplification of user endpoints

The structure of this library has been simplified, as the `LCA` class can now perform static, stochastic (Monte Carlo), iterative (scenario-based), and single-matrix LCA calculations. Matrix building has been moved to the [matrix_utils](https://github.com/brightway-lca/matrix_utils) library.

### Python 2 compatibility removed

Removing the Python 2 compatibility layer allows for much cleaner and more compact code, and the use of some components from the in-development Brightway version 3 libraries. Compatible with `bw2data` version 4.0.

### Removal of classes and methods

* `LCA.rebuild_*_matrix` methods are removed. See the [TODO]() notebook for alternatives.
* `DirectSolvingMixin` and `DirectSolvingMonteCarloLCA` are removed, direct solving is now the default
* `ComparativeMonteCarlo` is removed, use `MultiLCA(use_distributions=True)` instead
* `SingleMatrixLCA` is remove, use `LCA` instead. It allows for empty biosphere matrices.

### Simplified handling of mapping dictionaries

Mapping dictionaries map the database identifiers to row and column indices. In 2.5, these mapping dictionaries are only created on demand; avoiding their creation saves a bit of time and memory.

Added a new class (`DictionaryManager`) and made it simpler reverse, remap, and get the original dictionaries inside an `LCA`. Here is an example:

```python
LCA.dicts.biosphere[x]
>> y
LCA.dicts.biosphere.original # if remapped with activity keys
LCA.dicts.biosphere.reversed[y]  # (generated on demand)
>> x
```

The dictionaries in a conventional LCA are:

* LCA.dicts.product
* LCA.dicts.activity
* LCA.dicts.biosphere

~~`LCA.reverse_dict` is removed; all reversed dictionaries are available at `LCA.dicts.{name}.reversed`~~.

In 2.5, these mapping dictionaries are not automatically "remapped" to the `(database name, activity code)` keys. You will need to call `.remap_inventory_dicts()` after doing an inventory calculation to get mapping dictionaries in this format.

### Weighting is a diagonal matrix instead of a single number

It is easier to have everything in the same mode of operation. This also allows for the use of arrays, distributions, interfaces, etc. in weighting. Implemented in new `SingleValueDiagonalMatrix` class.

## Architectual changes

### Use of `bw_processing`

We now use [bw_processing](https://github.com/brightway-lca/bw_processing) to load processed arrays. `bw_processing` has separate files for the technosphere and biosphere arrays, and explicit indication of . Therefore, the `TechnosphereBiosphereMatrixBuilder` is no longer necessary, and is removed.

### No dependency on `bw2data`

`bw2data` is now an optional install, and even if available only a single utility function is used to prepare input data. `bw2calc` is primarily intended to be used as an independent library.

### Changes in Monte Carlo


## Smaller changes

### New LCA input specification

The existing input specification is still there, but this release also adds the ability to specify input arguments compatible with Brightway version 3. Previously, we would write `LCA({some demand}, method=foo)` - this requires `bw2calc` to use `bw2data` to figure out the dependent databases of the functional unit in `some demand`, and then to get the file paths of all the necessary files for both the inventory and impact assessment. The new syntax is `LCA({some demand}, data_objs)`, where `some demand` is already integer IDs, and `data_objects` is a lists of data packages (either in memory or on the filesystem).

`bw2data` has a helper function to prepare arguments in the new syntax: `prepare_lca_inputs`.

This new input syntax, with consistent column labels for all structured arrays, removes the need for `IndependentLCAMixin`. This is deleted, and the methods `get_vector`, `get_vector_metadata`, and `set_vector` are added.

### More robust matrix building

More tests were identified, and undefined behaviour is now specified. For example, the previous matrix builders assumed that the values in the provided row or column dictionaries were sequential integers starting from zero - this assumption is now relaxed, and we allow this dictionary values to start with an offset. There are also tests and documentation on what happens under various cases when `drop_missing` is `False`, but missing values are present.

=================

- FEATURE: Properly handle `substitution` type exchanges

0.16.1 (2014-12-05)
===================

- CHANGE: Better documentation for most code.
- BUGFIX: Graph traversal handles most coproducts, and raises sensible errors when it can't.

=================

- FEATURE: Changes in MatrixBuilder should make normal static LCA calculations about three times faster.

0.15.1 (2014-07-30)
===================

Update dependencies.

0.15 (2014-06-11)
=================

=================

- BREAKING CHANGE: LCA.fix_dictionaries now sets/uses ``_mapped_dict`` to determine if ``fix_dictionaries`` has been called.

0.12 (2014-02-13)

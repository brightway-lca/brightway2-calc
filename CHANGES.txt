Changelog
*********

Note: This changelog is not exhaustive.

1.4 (2016-07-14)
================

- Added utility functions for ``load_calculation_package`` and ``save_calculation_package`` for independent LCAs and cloud computing.
- Compatibility with bw2data 2.3

1.3.6 (2016-07-01)
==================

- Fixed bugs where RNG and technosphere matrix builder would change values in arrays meant to be static

1.3.5 (2016-07-01)
==================

- Fix bugs and add tests for ParameterVectorLCA

1.3.4 (2016-06-10)
==================

- Changed ParameterVectorLCA: Can no longer be called, split off rebuild_all into a separate method, added tests.

1.3.3 (2016-06-10)
==================

- Better test coverage and Windows comaptibility

1.3.2 (2016-06-08)
==================

- FEATURE: Add class and mixin for Monte Carlo using direct solvers
- CHANGE: Move tests to root directory and add Monte Carlo tests
- CHANGE: Consistent use of ``__next__`` and ``next()`` so that all Monte Carlo iterator classes are Py2/3 compatible and programmed the same way. ``ParameterVectorLCA.next()`` will no longer work on Python 3; instead, call ``next(ParameterVectorLCA)``. When providing a new vector, call the class itself (after it is instantiated): ``pv = ParameterVectorLCA(args); pv(new_vector)``.

1.3.1 (2016-06-06)
==================

- CHANGE:Updates for bw2data 2.2
- BUGFIX: Correctly handle regionalized CFs in site-generic calculations
- FEATURE: Add contribution methods to LCA classes

1.3 (2016-05-28)
================

- BUGFIX: Correctly handle project names in multiprocess calculations

1.2.1 (2016-03-14)
==================

- BUGFIX: switch_* was seriously broken due to new handling of processed arrays filepaths

1.2 (2016-03-14)
================

- Feature: Py3 compatibility
- FEATURE: Independent LCAs which don't rely on bw2data and the brightway2 ecosystem
- Feature: Add ``DenseLCA``
- FEATURE: Added switch_* and to_dataframe methods to LCA class
- FEATURE: Allow graph traversal to skip links in static databases
- BUGFIX: Terminate multiprocessing pools after calculations
- CHANGE: Load data automatically in Monte Carlo
- CHANGE: Automatically clean dirty databases before starting calculations

Plus lots of small bugfixes, and compatibility with ``projects``.

1.0 (2015-03-08)
================

- CHANGE: Split activities and products

0.17.1 (2015-02-13)
===================

- BUGFIX: Don't require substitution in ``TYPE_DICTIONARY``.

0.17 (2015-02-13)
=================

- FEATURE: Properly handle `substitution` type exchanges
- CHANGE: Compatible with bw2data version 2
- BUGFIX: Fix handling of nested dependent databases

0.16.1 (2014-12-05)
===================

- CHANGE: Better documentation for most code.
- BUGFIX: Graph traversal handles most coproducts, and raises sensible errors when it can't.

0.16 (2014-08-03)
=================

- FEATURE: Changes in MatrixBuilder should make normal static LCA calculations about three times faster.

0.15.1 (2014-07-30)
===================

Update dependencies.

0.15 (2014-06-11)
=================

- BREAKING CHANGE: Use ``Database.filename`` for processed data. Requires update to bw2data version 0.16 or greater.

0.13 (2014-04-16)
=================

- BREAKING CHANGE: LCA.fix_dictionaries now sets/uses ``_mapped_dict`` to determine if ``fix_dictionaries`` has been called.
- BUGFIX: LCA.build_demand_array doesn't break if ``fix_dictionaries`` has been called.

0.12 (2014-02-13)
=================

- BREAKING CHANGE: Matrix builder will only include parameter array rows that are correctly mapped, instead of raising an error when unmapped rows occur. This behaviour can be turned off by passing ``drop_missing=False``.

0.11.1 (2014-01-29)
===================

- BUGFIX: Change column names in method matrix building to be consistent with bw2data 0.11

0.11 (2014-01-26)
=================

- BREAKING CHANGE: Graph traversal was reworked, and some functionality for interpreting the output was moved to ``bw2analyzer``.
- BREAKING CHANGE: Deleted ``SimpleRegionalizedLCA`` class. Regionalization will be provided in bw2regional.
- BREAKING CHANGE: Deleted initial sensitivity work, moved for now to branch, as it was not yet usable.
- FEATURE: Much better and more thorough documentation.
- FEATURE: Improved testing and test coverage
